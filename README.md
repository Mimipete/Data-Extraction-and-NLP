Extraction of textual data articles
<p>Data extraction is the process of retrieving Specific data from various sources such as databases, websites,<br>
documents or other data storage systems.
<p>Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers<br>
to understand, interprete and generate human language by combining computational linguistics with machine learning<br>
to process text and speech allowing machines to read, recognize patterns and extract maening from languages in<br>
a way that mimics human understanding.<br>
The objective of this task is to extract textual data articles from a given URL and perform text analysis to compute<br>
a set of explained variables. while ensuring that the program extracts only the article title and the article text.<br>
